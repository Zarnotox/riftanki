This project, Riftbound Anki Study Decks, provides a powerful learning resource for the Riftbound community. Its goal is to help players master the card pool of new sets quickly and effectively through the use of Anki, a highly popular, free, and open-source flashcard program that uses Spaced Repetition to optimize learning.

Instead of requiring players to manually create their own study materials, this tool automates the entire process. A Python script will fetch the latest card information using the riftbound API. It then generates ready-to-use Anki decks that players can immediately import and start studying.

To support different learning styles, the project will generate multiple deck types, such as visual card recognition (image -> name) and detailed stat memorization (name -> stats). These decks will be kept up-to-date with each new set release and will be shared freely with all players on the official AnkiWeb shared deck repository.
